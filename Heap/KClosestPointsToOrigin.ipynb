    "Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2).\n",
    "\n",
    "You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).\n",

    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], k = 1\n",
    "Output: [[-2,2]]\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).\n",
    "The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).\n",
    "Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.\n",
    "We only want the closest k = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2,2]].\n",
